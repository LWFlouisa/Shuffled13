# Shuffled13
This shows the source code for Shuffled 13, and how it allows for granular levels of access controls within a gaming forum ecosystem.

## Purpose
What a lot of people don't think about with Ciphers is their respective strength levels rather than permission controls within a given cipher type. This approach applies to shufflinf alphabets for Rot13. Such as only having some Cipher texts solveable by some player classes.

Which here means if you were to apply the same concept to Polyalphabetic Ciphers, then suddenly you can create access permission levels for different Cipher texts of the same type.

What I'm less sure is if that's a unique thing about substitution ciphers, or if transposition ones can do that as well.
